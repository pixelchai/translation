This song is definitely one of my favourite in Aimer's album, "Bitter and Sweet". The album is one of Aimer's earlier albums and is basically a collection of covers. It's often overlooked but there are some great stuff in there, and I especially like the English covers too.

That said, I also do love the original version as well, which is by Yumi Matsutoya (AKA Yumi Arai). In fact, listening to the original is what first led me down the rabbit hole of 80's Japanese music which ended up becoming the defining sound of late 2019 and early 2020 for me -- as I would often just play those types of songs in the background as I worked on my Computer Science coursework.

Yumi Matsutoya has some other great songs too, probably most famously [春よ来い](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgUEXe019l0) but I also really like [雨の街を](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EEI30qzLMg) and [真珠のピアス](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSdFHH9jghY).

どうして どうして僕たちは
出逢ってしまったのだろう？
こわれるほど抱きしめた
最後の春に⾒た⼣陽は
うろこ雲照らしながら
ボンネットに消えてった

Doushite doushite bokutachi wa
Deatte shimatta no darou
Kowareru hodo dakishimeta
Saigo no haru ni mita yuuhi wa
Urokokumo terashi nagara
Bonnetto ni kietetta

Why oh why did we
have to meet, I wonder?
You held me so hard that I fell apart
We watched as that final spring's sunset
lit up the Cirrocumulus clouds
and dissappeared into the car's bonnet

//

引き返してみみるわ
ひとつ前のカーブまで
いつか海に降りた
あの駐⾞場に
あなたがいたようで

Hikikaeshite miru wa
Hitotsu mae no kaabu made
Itsuka umi ni orita
Ano chuushajou ni
Anata ga ita you de

I try return back
until I reach that previous curve
And when I reached the beach
It almost felt like I could feel you in that car park

//

どうして どうして私達
離れてしまったのだろう
あんなに愛してたのに
岬の灯冴えはじめる
同じ場所に⽴つけれど
潮⾵ 肩を抱くだけ

Doushite doushite watashitachi
Hanarete shimatta no darou
Anna ni aishiteta noni
Misaki no akari sae hajimeru
Onaji basho ni tatsu keredo
Shiokaze kata wo daku dake

Why oh why did we
have to get separated
even though I loved you that much
