This song is actually one of the songs that really pushed me over the edge to try and make this website (which explains why it is the first song on the website too, I suppose).

It was shown to me by a friend and I have listened to this song over and over so many times now. I am always compelled by the emotion I hear in the singer's voice and his words, however, for some bits of the song it's just a bit too fast for me and I can't fully understand it unless I were to, say, slow it down and properly think about the lyrics/translate the lyrics myself (hint hint) or find a translation somewhere.

Well, the thing is, I've looked and looked and there doesn't seem to be an English translation of this song anywhere on the internet. Even for just the transcription of the song, I could only find one source: [http://www.nextenglish.net/en/jpop/2805](http://www.nextenglish.net/en/jpop/2805) (I ended up transcribing the lyrics myself as well though, because the one on that website was the transcription of a variant of the song, which had slightly different lyrics).

This is my first time seeing a song that seems to be so popular yet unpopular at the same time --- it's got 4.4M views on YouTube at the time of writing [[screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/8Cf2C7t.png)]. I haven't found a single English comment in the comments section so far though. Perhaps this suggests that this song is popular in Japan but not very popular elsewhere.

I wonder if this translation will help more non-Japanese-speaking people find this song. I hope so. It's a good song.

乾杯！
誕生日おめでとう！
いやあしかしあっというまだよな
俺たち今年２６だぜ

いやあしかしこの前の飲み会も
めっちゃめっちゃ盛り上がったよな
アイツ目覚めたら逗子にいたらしいぜ

笑えるよな？
いやあ俺たち本当に幸せもんだよ
デッカイ夢があって
それを語り合える友達がいて

女はいないけど
酒はうまいし
悪くない！

悪くない。。。
とは思うんだ。。。

けどさ。。。
いや、全然大した話じゃないんだけど
俺お前に言わなくちゃいけないことあるんだよね。。。

そういやさ
飲み会の帰り道突如やってくる
あの虚しさ。。。
あれ。。。なんだろうね
アレヤバくね？？
胸。。。痛くね？

ごめん！
どうでもいいか
いやあ、
話しつのは。。。

ごめんな友よ
俺はもういくよ
居酒屋だけの意気込みじゃごみだ

お前も本当は気づいてるんだ
素面じゃ語れぬ夢は惨めだ

現実は辛い、暗い
ときに苦しい
それでも妄想よりは眩しい

本気をだしたらヤバイ
俺よりいつだって本気なお前がヤバイ

汗を千切る
涙ちょん切る
そびえ立つビールに桜散る散る

飲み干すビール
時間が過ぎる
この街で迎えた六度目の春

今年こそ？
来年こそ？

今日が終わる
いや、今が終わる
そう思えた奴から明日が変わる

真っ暗闇の未来に書きなぐる
蛍光ペンを求めて
半径０メートルの世界を変える
革命起こす幕開けの夜

Cheers!
Happy birthday!
Ah~ but I guess there's still a while to go huh?
We're gonna be 26 this year ya know

Ah~ but the drinking party we just had-
it was super super crazy wasn't it
When that guy woke up, he seemed to be in Zushi

Ah~ but us guys really have it so good
We dream big dreams
and have friends to talk about them with

I don't have a girl but...
The sake tastes good
This ain't bad at all!

Ain't bad at all...
is what I thought.

But uh...
I mean-... It isn't a big deal or anything at all
but there's something I have to tell you

Come to think of it,
That sudden wave of emptiness on the way home after drinking...
I wonder what that was
Isn't that bad??
Doesn't... your chest hurt?

Sorry!
It's whatever
But uh...
the thing I wanted to talk about...

Sorry mate!
I'm gonna leave now
Enthusiasm that exists only in pubs is garbage

In truth, you've realised it too:
when you're sober, those unspoken dreams are miserable

Reality is difficult, dark
and sometimes unbearable
but even that's dazzling compared to delusion

If I were to get serious, it'd get crazy
But you're always more crazily serious than me

Tear apart your sweat
Tear apart your tears
Let the towering beer scatter cherry blossoms

Drink up the beer
Time flies by
and it's our sixth time meeting up in this town

This year?
Next year?
How many more years am I even planning to live?

I'm ending it today
No, I'm ending it now
The dude who thought so is going to change tomorrow
