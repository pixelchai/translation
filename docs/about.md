I self-taught myself Japanese and German (though I also did German in school for 3 years as well) because I like languages and I think those two are particularly awesome. I'm native in English and Nepalese and I did a bit of French and Latin in school too, though there are also many other languages I want to explore more too!

This website is a product of my love for languages and music.
Like I say, I'm not native in Japanese or German and I'm learning and practising as I go along, so let me know if there are any errors.

You can find some more of my projects other than translating over at my [main site](/).

Thanks for visiting!
