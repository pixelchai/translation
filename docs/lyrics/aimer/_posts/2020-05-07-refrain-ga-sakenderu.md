This song is definitely one of my favourite in Aimer's album, "Bitter and Sweet". The album is one of Aimer's earlier albums and is basically a collection of covers. It's often overlooked but there are some great stuff in there, and I especially like the English covers too.

That said, I also do love the original version as well, which is by Yumi Matsutoya (AKA Yumi Arai). In fact, listening to the original is what first led me down the rabbit hole of 80's Japanese music which ended up becoming the defining sound of late 2019 and early 2020 for me -- as I would often just play those types of songs in the background as I worked on my Computer Science coursework.

Yumi Matsutoya has some other great songs too, probably most famously [春よ来い](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgUEXe019l0) but I also really like [雨の街を](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EEI30qzLMg) and [真珠のピアス](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSdFHH9jghY).

Why oh why did we<br>
