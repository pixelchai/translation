This song is actually one of the songs that really pushed me over the edge to try and make this website (which explains why it is the first song on the website too, I suppose).

It was shown to me by a friend and I have listened to this song over and over so many times now. I am always compelled by the emotion I hear in the singer's voice and his words, however, for much of the song it's just a bit too fast for me and I can't fully understand it unless I were to, say, slow it down and properly think about the lyrics/translate the lyrics myself (hint hint) or find a translation somewhere.

Well, the thing is, I've looked and looked and there doesn't seem to be an English translation of this song anywhere on the internet. Even for just the transcription of the song, I could only find one source: [http://www.nextenglish.net/en/jpop/2805](http://www.nextenglish.net/en/jpop/2805) (I ended up transcribing the lyrics myself as well though, because the one on that website was the transcription of a variant of the song, which had slightly different lyrics).

This is my first time seeing a song that seems to be so popular yet unpopular at the same time --- it's got 4.4M views on YouTube at the time of writing [[screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/8Cf2C7t.png)]. I haven't found a single English comment in the comments section so far though. Perhaps this suggests that this song is popular in Japan but not very popular elsewhere.

I wonder if this translation will help more non-Japanese-speaking people find this song. I hope so. It's a good song.

UPDATE: After spending around three hours of trying to translate this song and after looking up stuff, talking to Japanese friends and so on, I have only translated just under two minutes of the song. This song is quite poetic and many verses left me with no idea on how to translate them at all. I feel that me stumbling through the rest of the song at this point would be doing the song a disservice and so I have decided to instead move on to something else. Hopefully I shall return to the song and do it proper justice in the future, once I have improved enough.
